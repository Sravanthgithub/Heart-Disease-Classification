# Heart-Disease-Classification

This Project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Language used - `Python`

Modules used - `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-Learn`

Data collected from Kaggle's Heart Disease Classification UCI - https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci 

Goal - Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome. Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy. Examine trends & correlations within our data Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis

Algorithms used - `Logistic Regression` , `Random Forest Classifier`, `KNN`
